# Blackjack-in-C

Final Group Project for SFWRENG 2XC3

Overview: Blackjack recreated with C for a linux environment, with a GUI (team project).

♠️ As a final group project, I worked in a small team of 4 to develop Blackjack in C, working with a terminal interface or with a GUI.

I worked on the card logic, handling game over states, the main game loop, and part of the build coverage tests and GitHub Actions.

## Run with terminal interface
```bash
make
./blackjack
```

## Run with GUI
```bash
make gui_blackjack
./gui_blackjack
```
